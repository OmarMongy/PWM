# Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Verilog Controller

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Verilog project that implements a configurable Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller. The PWM controller is a widely used technique for efficiently controlling the power delivered to loads and regulating signals. The project includes two modules: PWM and timer_counter_inp, providing users with a versatile and customizable PWM solution for various applications.

## PWM Module
The PWM module generates the PWM signal based on the duty cycle value and the timer. The module takes user-defined parameters, such as resolution (R) and timer width (Timer), to tailor the PWM controller for specific requirements. This module utilizes two internal registers, **Q_reg** and **D_reg**, to store the current values for the counter and the duty cycle comparison.

**Inputs**
- **clk**: Clock signal used for synchronization.
- **reset_n**: Asynchronous active-low reset signal.
- **Final_Value**: Timer value representing the PWM period.
- **duty**: Duty cycle value.

**Outputs**
- **pwm_out**: The PWM output signal.

## Operation
- The PWM module continuously monitors the `tick` signal generated by the `timer_counter_inp` module to determine the appropriate time to update the PWM signal.
- On each clock edge, the PWM module increments the current PWM timer value (`Q_reg`) and compares it with the duty cycle value. If the current timer value is less than the duty cycle value, the PWM output (`pwm_out`) is set to high, otherwise low.
- When the counter reaches the `Final_Value`, it generates a `done` signal to indicate that a complete PWM period has elapsed. At this point, the counter is reset, and the next PWM period starts.
- The `reset_n` input is used to initialize the PWM module and counter to a known state when the reset is asserted.
- Overall, the PWM module generates a PWM signal with a variable duty cycle specified by the duty input, where the duty cycle is a value between 0 and (`2^R - 1`). The counter counts up to Final_Value, and the PWM output is high (1) when the counter value is less than the duty cycle, and low (0) otherwise. The PWM signal repeats with the frequency of the clock.


## Timer Counter Module
The timer_counter_inp module is a configurable timer counter that counts from 0 to the user-defined **final_value**. It provides a simple and efficient way to generate timing signals for various applications.


**Inputs**
- **clk**: Clock signal used for synchronization.
- **reset_n**: Asynchronous active-low reset signal.
- **enable**: Control signal to enable the timer.
- **final_value**: The final value for the timer counter.

**Outputs**
- **done**: Indicates when the timer has reached the final_value.

## Operation
The timer counter module uses an always block triggered on the positive clock edge and negative reset signal to update the counter's value when the enable signal is high. When the counter reaches the **final_value**, the **done** output is set high, indicating that the desired timing interval has elapsed ,One of the key features of the timer_counter_inp module is its ability to control the frequency of the output PWM signal.
By configuring the final_value parameter, users can adjust the timer's counting value, which directly affects the PWM frequency.
The PWM frequency is inversely proportional to the timer's counting value. A larger final_value will result in a slower counting rate, leading to a lower PWM frequency. Conversely, a smaller final_value will increase the counting rate and raise the PWM frequency.
