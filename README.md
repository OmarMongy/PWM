# Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Verilog Controller

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Verilog project that implements a configurable Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller. The PWM controller is a widely used technique for efficiently controlling the power delivered to loads and regulating signals. The project includes two modules: PWM and timer_counter_inp, providing users with a versatile and customizable PWM solution for various applications.

## PWM Module
The PWM module generates the PWM signal based on the duty cycle value and the timer. The module takes user-defined parameters, such as resolution (R) and timer width (Timer), to tailor the PWM controller for specific requirements. This module utilizes two internal registers, Q_reg and D_reg, to store the current values for the counter and the duty cycle comparison.

**Inputs**
- clk: Clock signal used for synchronization.
- reset_n: Asynchronous active-low reset signal.
- Final_Value: Timer value representing the PWM period.
- duty: Duty cycle value.

**Outputs**
- pwm_out: The PWM output signal.

**Operation**
The always block triggered on the positive clock edge and negative reset signal is responsible for updating the Q_reg and D_reg values based on the current tick signal.
The always block triggered on any change in the inputs is responsible for calculating the next values for Q_reg and D_reg based on the current values, thus generating the PWM output.

## Timer Counter Module
The timer_counter_inp module is a configurable timer counter that counts from 0 to the user-defined final_value. It provides a simple and efficient way to generate timing signals for various applications.

**Inputs**
- clk: Clock signal used for synchronization.
- reset_n: Asynchronous active-low reset signal.
- enable: Control signal to enable the timer.
- final_value: The final value for the timer counter.

**Outputs**
- done: Indicates when the timer has reached the final_value.

**Operation**
The timer counter module uses an always block triggered on the positive clock edge and negative reset signal to update the counter's value when the enable signal is high. When the counter reaches the final_value, the done output is set high, indicating that the desired timing interval has elapsed.

## Applications and Uses of PWM
